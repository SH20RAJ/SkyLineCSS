# Installation

To use SkyLineCSS, you can include the following CSS file in your project:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/skyline.min.css">
```

### CDN

If you prefer, you can also use a CDN link:

```html
<!-- Latest version -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/sh20raj/SkyLineCSS@latest/skyline.min.css">
```

Replace `"path/to/skyline.css"` with the actual path to your `skyline.css` file in your project directory.

### Downloading SkyLineCSS

If you want to host the CSS file yourself, you can download it from the [SkyLineCSS GitHub repository](https://github.com/example/skylinecss) or use the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sh20raj/skylinecss
```

Once downloaded, link the `skyline.css` file in your HTML:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/skylinecss/skyline.css">
```

### Using with Package Managers

If you're using npm or yarn, you can install SkyLineCSS as a package:

```bash
npm install skylinecss
```

or

```bash
yarn add skylinecss
```

Then include it in your project:

```

### Using with React or Vue
